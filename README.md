2. **Start the Project**: After successfully installing the dependencies, start the project:

   ```bash
   yarn dev

## Features

### Extensible State Management
We've harnessed the power of Redux to manage the state of planets, vehicles, and total travel time. Redux ensures a robust and organized state management system, making the application highly maintainable and extensible.

### Responsive Design
Our project is designed to adapt to various devices and screen sizes. We've used media queries to provide a seamless experience across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

### Dependency Management
We rely on Yarn as our dependency manager, ensuring efficient package management and reproducibility of your development environment.

### Modular Architecture
To enhance code maintainability and readability, we've adopted a modular approach. The project leverages Redux to extract state management logic from React components, promoting clean and organized code.

### User-Friendly Error Handling
Our user interface offers a smooth experience. The "Find Falcone" button is activated only when all necessary selections are made, complemented by color cues for clear user guidance. We've also included a reset button to clear selected fields. In case of API failures, our error handling mechanism provides options for refreshing the data, ensuring an uninterrupted journey.
